                    <p id="bnb-last-updated"></p>
                
                    <p>1. <strong>BNC Stock Price.</strong> Reflects the trading price for BNC common stock per share as reported by Nasdaq. Price and volume data are sourced from Nasdaq’s website and may be delayed. Intraday market movement and fluctuations may not be reflected and stock may differ from prices displayed on brokerage platforms or subsequent market activity. Prices are shown in U.S. dollars and rounded to the nearest cent.</p>
                
                    <p>2. <strong>Total BNB Holdings.</strong> Represents the most recently publicly announced number of BNB tokens held; BNB holdings are only updated periodically and not updated in real time.</p>
                
                    <p>3. <strong>Estimated Holdings Value.</strong> Calculated as Total BNB Holdings multiplied by the BNB Price based upon data displayed. USD conversions use the reference price indicated under “BNB Price.” The Holdings Value is a point-in-time estimate and may not reflect proceeds realizable upon sale, which could be affected by liquidity, execution costs, slippage, and fees. Figures are presented on a gross basis and exclude custody, trading, or other transaction costs.</p>
                
                    <p>4. <strong>BNB Price.</strong> Represents the trading price of BNB in U.S. dollars as quoted by CoinMarketCap and may be delayed. The reported price may differ from prices available on specific trading venues due to liquidity, spreads, and market differences. Prices are rounded to the nearest cent.</p>
                
                    <p>5. <strong>Average Cost Basis.</strong> Reflects the treasury’s estimated total acquisition cost, based on the most recent publicly reported figure, divided by Total BNB Holdings. Average Cost Basis is only updated periodically based on previously publicly released information and may not accurately reflect interim changes to such figure. The figure is based on internal accounting records and may be updated to reflect post-trade adjustments, corporate actions, or reconciliations. The methodology is intended for illustrative purposes only and may differ from GAAP/IFRS accounting treatments.</p>
                
                    <p>6. <strong>Est. Change in Value of BNB Holdings.</strong> Represents an estimate of the difference between Holdings Value and the aggregate cost basis of Total BNB Holdings, stated in U.S. dollars, along with the percentage change versus cost basis. This metric is unrealized and does not reflect taxes, fees, spreads, or liquidation impacts. Performance is sensitive to market volatility; actual realized results may differ materially from unrealized amounts.</p>
                
                    <p>7. <strong>Average Daily Volume (BNC).</strong> Reflects the average daily volume of BNC shares traded on Nasdaq during the most recent 30 trading days, unless otherwise specified. Data is sourced from Nasdaq’s website and may be delayed and may not include off-market transfers not captured by primary reporting venues. Volume figures are for informational purposes and may not be reflective of current or future volume or liquidity of shares of BNC.</p>
                
                    <p>8. <strong>mNAV.</strong> Calculated as an estimate of the Company’s non-diluted common stock market capitalization value, as provided in the Company’s most recent public disclosures, divided by the Est. Holdings Value, expressed as a multiple (e.g., 0.45x). The calculation uses the estimated BNC market capitalization, based upon BNC Price as provided by Nasdaq (data may be delayed). mNAV does not take into account or include the Company's indebtedness or non-treasury assets or liabilities. As such, it is not equivalent to "net asset value" or "NAV" or any similar metric in the traditional financial context or to the NAV used by other companies, and it is not a measure of either the net asset value of the Company or the value of the BNB held by the Company net of indebtedness and other obligations. Estimates may not include non-treasury assets and liabilities, intangible assets, and other factors. Information provided is an estimate for illustrative purposes. Investors should consult the Company’s financial statements, risk factors and all other disclosures contained in Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Annual Reports on Form 10-K filed with the SEC prior to making any investment decision.</p>
                
                    <p>9. <strong>[BNB from Airdrops].</strong> Represents the most recent publicly reported data for the estimated cumulative amount of BNB provided following the conversion of ‘airdrop’ units received via network distributions, protocol incentives, or similar on-chain events credited to treasury wallets.</p>
                
                    <p>10. <strong>Weekly Change Metrics.</strong> Where weekly percentage changes are presented (e.g., Weekly BNB Change, Weekly BNC Change), changes are measured between the most recent trading day’s closing price and the closing trading price one week prior, based on reported data from Nasdaq and CoinMarketCap, which may be delayed. Past performance is not indicative of future results.</p>
                
                    <p>11. <strong>NAV per Share.</strong> Represents an estimate of the Estimated Holdings Value divided by the Company’s most recent public disclosure of total shares of BNC common stock outstanding. Estimates may not include non-treasury assets and liabilities, intangible assets, and other factors. Information provided is an estimate for illustrative purposes. Investors should consult the Company’s financial statements, risk factors and all other disclosures contained in Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Annual Reports on Form 10-K filed with the SEC prior to making any investment decision.</p>
